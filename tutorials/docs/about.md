## My Bio

I was born in Sari, Mazandaran, Iran. I am graduated in Master of science in Electronics in Sharif University, Tehran, Iran.

## My Interests

I am mostly interested in *(Linux/Arm) Embedded Systems* and also *Robotics* and among all of methods has been designed, I love ROS (Robotic Operating System), because it's very easy to use and we can use this via many programming languages such as C++, Python, Javascript and etc.
Also I found that Ardupilot is a very professional open source package for driving so many kinds of robots such as Planes, Copters and Rovers. So I decided to use this tool for driving simple robots and also using ROS for controlling it.

Also I am an expert in using ARM Micro-Controllers (STM32) in robotics and I am able to communicate directly between these kind of processors and ROS. This could be used to design simple robots under ROS functions.

I am here to share my Robotics knowledge to everybody. If you are interested in my example packages and its docuemnts, do not hesitate to join in my git repository and be a contributer.  

You can directly ask me about my packages for free via one of these methods:
